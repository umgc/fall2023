# SWEN 670 - Software Engineering Capstone Code of Conduct

## Purpose
This document is here to guide us through our SWEN 670 journey. Our aim? To collaborate smoothly, be respectful of one another, and enjoy the process of building something great together.

## 1. Collaboration and Teamwork
- Every voice matters. Everyone should have an opportunity to contribute.
- Ideas vary, and that's okay. Let's value each perspective and foster healthy discussions.
- If disagreements pop up, let's focus on resolving the topic at hand. Together, we can find common ground.

## 2. A Touch of Professionalism
- Let's maintain respect in all our interactions, be it with peers or faculty.
- Deadlines help us stay on track. Let's do our best to meet them.
- If challenges arise, it's okay! Communicate and lean on your team for support.

## 3. Academic Integrity
- Originality shines. When we use external sources, let's give credit where it's due.
- Teamwork is key, but ensure your contributions reflect your effort.

## 4. Celebrate Diversity
- Every one of us brings a unique perspective. Let's appreciate and learn from our varied backgrounds.
- Respectful communication is the way to go, ensuring everyone feels included.

## 5. Virtual Collaboration
- Since we're often working online:
    - Be considerate of scheduled meetings and differing time zones.
    - Let's keep our communication channels clear and efficient.
    - Personal information? Share only if comfortable, and always with consent.

## 7. Accountability
- If issues persist, we might revisit team roles or dynamics for a smoother flow.
- In some cases, a chat with the instructor might be beneficial to address any concerns.
- As always, our goal is to learn, adapt, and grow together.
